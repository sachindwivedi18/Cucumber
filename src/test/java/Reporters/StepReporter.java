/**
 * Cucumber reporter for ReportPortal that reports individual steps as test
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * Mapping between Cucumber and ReportPortal is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>feature - SUITE</li>
 * <li>scenario - TEST</li>
 * <li>step - STEP</li>
 * </ul>
 * Background steps are reported as part of corresponding scenarios. Outline
 * example rows are reported as individual scenarios with [ROW NUMBER] after the
 * name. Hooks are reported as BEFORE/AFTER_METHOD items (NOTE: all screenshots
 * created in hooks will be attached to these, and not to the actual failing
 * steps!)
